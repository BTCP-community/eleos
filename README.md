### Installation
Note: First time installations may take awhile to load since ~1GB of cryptographic data must be downloaded first.

##### Windows and MacOS
The simplest way to get started on Windows or MacOS is to [download and run the latest installer](https://github.com/zencashofficial/eleos/releases).

##### Linux
Note: Eleos requires that the compiled wallets are named zcashd-linux or zcld-linux and are saved into the eleos directory.
